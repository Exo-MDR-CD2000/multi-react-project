# React Site WIP Final Project
Static React project based around cooking recipes.
## Description

This is assignment is a month long final project based on React and Typescript. The foundation for this project has been made and will be based around user created cooking recipes that can be saved to a local backend like json-server. Editing and deleting of recipes is planned as well as using Spoonacular for fetching an online database of cooking recipes. The recipes will be displayed as cards. This first week is to demonstrate a mockup of a static site with some example data that will be used and must fulfill the following criteria:


## Project Requirements

1. It has at least 3 React components
   - A component is a function that returns JSX and components are used like they’re an HTML element.
   - `main.tsx` does not count as a component, it doesn’t have a function that returns JSX.

2. It’s displaying the test data
   - You can put your array of data in whatever file you want, or even in its own file.

3. It’s using at least 1 prop on your own components
   - A prop is set like it’s an HTML attribute, and received as a destructured parameter property.
   - `key` does not count for this, you need to come up with your own prop and practice setting it and receiving it.

4. No red errors/warnings in the console in the browser.

5. No type errors in VS Code.

## Usage

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps. This also assumes you have node installed to download npm packages.

1. **Clone the repo (SSH Method Below)**
    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:Exo-MDR-CD2000/multi-react-project.git
    ```
2. **Checkout Branch into "week-14-react-static"**
    ```sh
    git checkout week-14-react-static
    ```
3. **Install required packages**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4. **Open a second terminal in the project repo to start Vite**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

The React project will start and display the static data that I was using for testing. The form is actually working, but is not a requirement for this week.
